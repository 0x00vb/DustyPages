AI/Developer Prompt: Offline Book Reader Web App for iOS 9 (PDF + EPUB)
üîñ Project Summary

Develop a lightweight, offline-first book reader as a self-contained web app designed specifically for iOS 9 Safari (e.g., on an iPad 2). It must allow users to load PDF and EPUB files, read them offline, and customize the reading experience with themes and font settings. No cloud dependencies or third-party APIs are allowed. The goal is full control, usability, and compatibility with outdated hardware.
üéØ Primary Goals

    ‚úÖ Seamless reading experience for EPUB and PDF

    ‚úÖ Fully offline capable

    ‚úÖ Runs on Safari iOS 9 (iPad 2)

    ‚úÖ Customizable UI: themes, fonts, sizes

    ‚úÖ Local book management (load from device)

    ‚úÖ Simple, responsive, touch-friendly UI

üìÅ Core Features
1. File Management

    Load .epub and .pdf files from local device (via <input type="file">)

    Store uploaded books in IndexedDB or localStorage

    List uploaded books on homepage

    Delete book option

2. Reader UI

    Smooth display of EPUB (pagination or scrolling)

    PDF rendering with zoom & page navigation

    Persistent reading position tracking per book

3. Customization Options

    Themes:

        Light (white bg, black text)

        Sepia (warm beige bg, brown text)

        Dark (black bg, white text)

    Fonts:

        Serif (Georgia or similar)

        Sans-serif (Helvetica or similar)

        Dyslexic-friendly font (if lightweight version available)

    Font Sizes:

        Small / Medium / Large / Extra-Large

    Margin/padding adjustments (basic)

4. Offline Support

    Cache assets and books using IndexedDB, AppCache, or localStorage (since iOS 9 doesn‚Äôt support Service Workers)

    Ensure books and styles work after refresh and airplane mode

5. User Interface

    Simple, mobile-first design

    Touch gestures: swipe for next/previous page (if feasible)

    Clean, distraction-free reading mode

    Lightweight icons (SVG or inline)

üß™ Technical Constraints
Browser Target: Safari iOS 9

    No fetch, use XMLHttpRequest

    No Promise, use callbacks or include a polyfill

    No Service Worker, use AppCache or manual caching

    Use epub.js v0.3.x (older versions more compatible)

    Use a lightweight fork of pdf.js, or basic version from 2015‚Äì2017

Language/Stack

    HTML5 + CSS3 (no SASS/PostCSS)

    JavaScript ES5 (strictly avoid ES6+ syntax)

    No frameworks like React/Vue ‚Äî only vanilla JS

    Avoid heavy dependencies
